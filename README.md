## Prediction of Energy Demand by Neighborhoods in Barcelona for Sustainable Resource Management

### Abstract
Electricity is a fundamental element of contemporary society and an indicator of technological development. The challenge of ensuring the sustainable use of resources is presented as a global priority, where optimization becomes an essential tool. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy consumption in the European Union decreased by 3.2% in 2022, the second-largest drop since 2009. Although recovery is expected, negative electricity prices have become more common, reflecting market instability and the need for better management.

This study focuses on predicting electricity demand in the city of Barcelona, using artificial intelligence algorithms. These predictions and the associated uncertainty provide tools for the optimization and management of resources.

### Keywords
Energy efficiency, electricity consumption, demand forecasting, artificial intelligence, market volatility, Barcelona.

# INTRODUCTION

The growing demand for energy, combined with the need to reduce emissions of harmful gases, has made the efficient management of energy resources one of the major challenges in modern cities. This challenge is especially relevant as energy continues to be a limited resource, and due to the inability to store energy efficiently. It emphasizes the need to have a better understanding of the necessary production to reduce resource waste.

Global growth in energy consumption, particularly in regions like Asia and Oceania, where the Chinese economy has been one of the main drivers of energy consumption, has made research in energy efficiency (EE) increasingly important. Global energy consumption has increased by more than 50% between 1993 and 2012. As cities move toward more service-based economies, energy efficiency in production processes will not lose its relevance.

This study focuses on predicting electricity demand in Barcelona, broken down by postal codes. To address this challenge, various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and neural networks, will be used, and the results of these will be measured through various metrics, with the aim of improving the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

In addition to the creation of the predictive model, during this process, knowledge about the nature of the phenomenon and energy consumption in the Barcelona region can be extracted. This will enable a better understanding of local energy dynamics and improve the capacity to respond to fluctuations in demand.

One of the main objectives of this work is to generate a tool that allows for better management of energy resources and minimizes the impact of energy market volatility. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with these predictions will be analyzed to ensure the reliability of the results obtained and provide an additional tool for decision-making.

In conclusion, the use of AI systems for energy demand forecasting represents a step towards more efficient management, making a more responsible use of available resources without compromising societal development and the needs associated with contemporary cities.
